Here is an example idea! 

PROBLEM: The world does not have enough food truck apps. We need to build the
best one. Based on the data, only 12% of apps are food truck tracking apps.
Other data suggests that the optimal percentage of food truck apps is closer to
37%. 

SO- the idea is to build a food truck app building platform that will enable us
to build so many food truck apps. 

WHO IS WITH ME?
