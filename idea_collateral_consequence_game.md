# Collateral Consequence Simulator

Like the game of life, but more life-like. 

The idea is to create a game, like the Oregon Trail, but for the modern wilderness. This game could be a great way to explore the human consequences of various issues that, when life is good and empathy is low, are hard to imagine. Basic stats would determine the likelihood of certain events. 

Possible setups:

The Opoid Trail -- a journey that explores how easy it is for people to get hooked on opiods after surgery/injury/chronic pain, and the consequences it has on finances, health, relationship, access to credit, jobs, housing, etc. 

Mental Combat -- a journey that explores the vast consequences of living w/ mental illness-- finances, health, relationship, access to credit, jobs, housing, etc. 

Other topics- 
- veterans issues
- lack of health insurance
- student debt


Really, the list of scenarios that can quickly get out of hand is endless! So is the capacity to spread compassion, awareness, and empathy of the plight of fellow humans.
