# Legislation Tracker

Using an API like [sunlight labs] (https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) or [probublica](https://propublica.github.io/congress-api-docs/#congress-api-documentation) create an app that alerts users about issues they care about, and provide a way to contact their legislators (link to call, email, tweet, etc.)
